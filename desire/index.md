## What I would like to do

### Essentials

1. Research and acquisition of related knowledge
2. Work as an engineer to earn money

#### Research and acquisition of related knowledge

Currently, I am conducting research on persistent homology and natural language models for proteins, but I lack the necessary knowledge to effectively pursue these studies. To advance these research projects, I first need to acquire the relevant knowledge in these areas. At the same time, I want to dedicate more time to research to achieve better results during my master's program.

The knowledge related to each research topic is as follows:

##### Persistent homology

- General topology
- Probability and statistics

##### Natural language models for proteins

- Biological sciences (especially protein)
- Language model (such as transformer)
- Transfer learning
- General machine learning

#### Work as an engineer to earn money

Working as an engineer allows me to earn a living while building my future career. To enhance my future quality of life, I want to dedicate as much time as possible to my work as an engineer.

### Desirable

1. Develop various software applications
2. Study English
3. Hobbies

#### Develop various software applications

I have various software development projects in mind, but I haven't been able to work on them due to lack of time. I hope to find time to gradually work on software development.

#### Study English

Proficiency in English is essential for advancing various future activities. I want to allocate time to improve all four language skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) in a balanced manner.

#### Hobbies

There are many other things I want to do. I want to draw a lot of pictures, travel, and watch many movies. Time may be limited, but I want to make sure I take on these challenges.
